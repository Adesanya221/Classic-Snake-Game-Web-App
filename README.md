# Classic-Snake-Game-Web-App
The Classic Snake Game Web App is a browser-based, interactive version of the traditional snake game. Built entirely with HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS, this project showcases core frontend logic, dynamic rendering, and real-time user interaction without relying on external game engines. Designed for both fun and nostalgia.
